# Hello!
My name is Alex, and I am a 17 year old Sixth Form student, studying A level Maths, Computer Science and Physics.

I intend on going to University and get a bachelors degree in Computer Science, alongside gaining industry experience, and becoming more proficient in more languages.

## Learning
I am currently learning HTML & CSS and Django, but I intend to learn JavaScript, PHP and C++.

## Current Projects
For my A level, I am producing a python app (and potentially a webapp), using sqlite3, tkinter and maybe Django. 

## About me
As I have said, I am in Sixth Form, so I don't have much free time, however I do enjoy spending any time I get kayaking and swimming. 
I am also very enthusiastic about music, and especially any visual media and content associated to it. This interest has also led me to explore using Blender and Video Editing software such as Capcut. 
I also enjoy Space, and I own a telescope. I wish to begin astrophotography.
